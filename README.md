# WeatherApp

## Description
WeatherApp is an Android application that retrieves and stores **historical weather data** for any location and date using the free **Open-Meteo API**. The app saves maximum and minimum temperature data in a local **ROOM database**, ensuring offline access. For future dates, it applies an **ARIMA model** trained on the past 10 years of data to predict temperatures.

## Features

- Future Prediction: ARIMA-based forecasting for upcoming dates.  
- Local Database: Stores weather records in ROOM for offline access.  
- Offline Access: Query and view stored data without internet.  
- Modern UI: Built with Jetpack Compose for a clean and intuitive interface.
